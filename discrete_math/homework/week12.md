​	(1)

​	Suppose f1 = f2

​	Then x1 +  y1 + 1 = x2 + y2 + 1

​	x1 + y1 = x2 + y2

​	We can't tell x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 

​	So this is not injective

​	

​	Because the codomain is N, that mean f(<x,y>) could be 0.

​	However when f is 0, which means x + y + 1 = 0, x+ y = -1

​	But the domain is N, so x+y could not be -1

​	So this is not surjective

​	Because this is not surjective and not injective, so it is not bijective.

​	A = {(1,1), (0,2), (2,0)}

​	B = {3, 5, 7}
