a)

​	**reflexive**: Because `aRa`  for every a, so this is reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: Suppose that `aRb`, that `age(a) = age(b)` so `age(b) = age(a)`, that is `bRa`, so this is symmetric.

​	**transitive**: Suppose `aRb` and `bRc` , then `age(a) = age(b)` and `age(b) = age(c) `,then `age(a) = age(c)` , then `aRc`, so this is transitive.



b)

​	**reflexive**: Because `aRa`  for every a, so this is reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: Suppose that `aRb`, that `p(a) = p(b)` so `p(b) = p(a)`, that is `bRa`, so this is symmetric.

​	**transitive**: Suppose `aRb` and `bRc` , then `p(a) = p(b)` and `p(b) = p(c) `,then `p(a) = p(c)` , then `aRc`, so this is transitive.



c)

​	This does not meet transitive. 

​	**reflexive**: Because `aRa`  for every a, so this is reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: Suppose that `aRb` and `P(a) = X and Y` and `p(b) = X and Z` so `bRa`, so this is symmetric.
​	**transitive** : This does not meet transitive. Suppose `aRb` and `bRc`, `P(a) = X and Y`, `P(b) = Y and Z` and `P(c) = Z and M`, then that doesn't meet transitive.

​	

d)
	This does not meet transitive. 

​	**reflexive**: Because `aRa`  for every a, so this is reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: Suppose that `aRb`, that `a meet b` so `b meet a`, that is `bRa`, so this is symmetric.

​	**transitive**: This does not meet transitive. Suppose `aRb` and `bRc` , then `a meet b` and `b meet c`, that doesn't mean `a meet c` , so this does not meet transitive.



e)

​	This does not meet transitive. 

​	**reflexive**: Because `aRa`  for every a, so this is reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: Suppose that `aRb`, that `a speak a language which b also speak` so `b speak a language which a also speak` `, that is `bRa`, so this is symmetric.

​	**transitive**: This does not meet transitive. Suppose `aRb` and `bRc` , then `a speak a language which b also speak` and `b speak a language which c also speak`, that doesn't mean `a speak a language which c also speak ` , so this does not meet transitive.



2

​	**reflexive**: for each node this is a self loop for this node, so this reflexive.

​	**symmetric**: for each edge from one node to another node, there is also an edge form the seconde to the first one.  So this is symmetric.

​	**transitive**: when there exists an edge from node one to node two and an edge from node two to node three there always exists an edge from node one to node three. So this is transitive.

​	So this is an equivalence relation.



3

​	1)

​		**reflexive**:  for each x, because $(x,x) \in R$ so R is reflexive.

​		**symmetric**: Suppose $(x,y) \in R$ , that means x and y agree in the ﬁrst three bits, then y and x agree in the ﬁrst three bits, which means $(y,x) \in R$. So, R is  symmetric .

​		**transitive**: Suppose $(x,y) \in R$ and $(y,z) \in R$, that means x and y agree in the ﬁrst three bits and y and z agree in the ﬁrst three bits, then x and z agree in the ﬁrst three bits, which means $(x,z) \in R$, so R is transitive.



​	2)

​		a) : all strings which the first three are 010

​		b) : all strings which the first three are 101

​		c) : all strings which the first three are 111

​		d) : all strings which the first three are 010
